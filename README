# 🎂 Interactive Birthday Cake Project 🎉

## Overview

This Interactive Birthday Cake 🍰 project is a delightful web-based application designed for a special 18th birthday celebration. Users can interactively add candles 🕯️ to a birthday cake and blow them out using their microphone, combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a charming user experience.

## Features

- **Initial Candle Count:** The cake automatically loads with **18** candles on the very first visit, ensuring the correct count for the birthday.
- **Persistence:** The state of the candles (blown out or lit) is saved in the user's browser (Local Storage) so she can return later to see the cake as she left it.
- **Microphone Integration:** Blow into your mic to extinguish candles 🎤.
- **Interactive Cake:** Click to add more candles 🕯️ (these will also persist).
- **Candle Count:** Watch the candle count change dynamically 🔢.
